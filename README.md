# PhaseField-iRSF

Phase field model for Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip (SEAS) using an invariant, consistently-linearized formulation of rate-and-state friction. The phase field method introduces regularisation of the fault width ensuring convergence of both strain-rate and strain-dependent properties, making it suitable for the accurate simulation fluid flow through fault zones. Results are in agreement with a discrete Finite Element Method model. Explanations and comparison are available in Gourdarzi et al., Computational Mechanics, 2023.
